Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

I will be on the job market in 2026, though I am also open to earlier placements.

My research investigates bias in evaluation and decision-making in the labor market, focusing on how individuals interpret signals such as identity and social stereotypes, and how (in)attention under uncertainty and asymmetric information shapes judgments of fairness, performance, and responsibility. I use experimental and behavioral methods combined with advanced process-tracing tools, including web-based eye-tracking and mouse-tracking.
